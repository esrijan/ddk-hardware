	+ Always to be OPERATED along with the usable sources, from which it has

	+ Not bound to free as in price. Which means, it doesn't stop anyone

	+ OPERATED in the hope to be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
	implied or explicit. It is to be OPERATED solely on one's own risk. You
	have been warned.

	+ OPERATED with the hope that someday the various OPERATORS would meet up
	and then share some glasses of juice, together.
